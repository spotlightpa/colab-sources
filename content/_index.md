Amplify Colorado Diverse Source Guide aims to ensure that Coloradoâ€™s local and statewide news coverage is more equitable and better reflects the communities it serves. 

The guide is a response to a call from community members and journalists of color who want to strengthen the relationship between newsrooms and Coloradans from diverse backgrounds of all kinds by broadening the range of voices, experiences and expertise in local news stories and by making it easier for community members to connect with their local reporters.

Information in this diverse source guide is voluntarily shared and self-reported by participants, and should be verified before publication.
