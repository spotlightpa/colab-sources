  "bio": "I’m the Senior Director of Statewide Civic Engagement at Rocky Mountain Public Media, where I lead Ambassador64 and Above the Noise—two interconnected initiatives shaping Colorado’s civic dialogue and deepening RMPM’s commitment to community co-ownership. Our team focuses on building statewide systems that weave listening, storytelling, and trust-building into everything we do. I design feedback loops, engagement frameworks, and partnership structures that elevate community voice and ensure RMPM continues moving toward a model where Coloradans are true co-creators and co-stewards of their public media.\n\nFor more than 25 years, I’ve worked throughout Colorado’s nonprofit sector in leadership and governance roles across health and human services, youth development, arts and culture, early education, food access, and nonprofit capacity-building. I specialize in building durable statewide networks, developing scalable community engagement systems, facilitating cross-sector partnerships, and guiding organizations through learning, change, and community-centered strategy.\n\nAs a proud member of the queer community, I center equity, inclusion, and belonging in everything I do. I’m committed to creating environments—whether in communities, partnerships, or collaborative spaces—where people feel seen, heard, and connected, and where the wisdom of lived experience meaningfully shapes our work.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy being outside as much as possible, biking, hiking, and running Colorado’s trails, writing poetry, listening to music, exploring spicy food and great wine, and sharing meaningful conversations with family, friends, and chosen family.",
