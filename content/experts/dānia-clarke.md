  "bio": "I'm the founder of BRIDGE™ (which stands for Building Relationships In Diverse Group Environments) — a social impact initiative using tools, workshops, events, and videos to foster meaningful connection and belonging across diverse communities.  \n\nFrom classrooms to nonprofits to everyday life, BRIDGE offers guidance for real-world connection—helping people engage on purpose, wherever they are.\n\nThe topic of human connection has lived in my head rent-free since 2015. I’m endlessly curious about what brings people together, what makes conversations meaningful, and how we can create spaces where connection thrives. BRIDGE™ officially launched in 2025 as a way to turn that curiosity into action—creating experiences that foster authentic connection.\n\nPartnerships include: Denver Public Schools, Bennington College, Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver.\n\nPast clients include: Denver International Airport, Kairoi Residential",
