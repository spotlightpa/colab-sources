Shortly after arriving in Pueblo, Gregory immediately realized the powerful and yet untold story of the new creative economy in one of America's great industrial landscapes which was once dominated by the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company and the Nuckolls Packing Company. Gregory is the owner of the award winning Kadoya Gallery and since his arrival in southern Colorado has launched the Shoe Factory, the ARTery, and the Underground in the Historic Federal Building. Over the years he has lectured extensively on the history, culture and the arts of Pueblo and is best known in the region for his talk on The Tunnels of Pueblo and Steel & Meat. He is a former Board Member of the Steelworks Center of the West and now advises The Arts Academy at Pueblo County High as a creative consultant and serves as a Board Member. In 2018 Gregory co-founded the Pueblo Regional Film Commission and serves as its acting commission which supports the recruitment of film and workforce development for content creation professionals. Gregory recently completed his term as the Commissioner on the Historic Preservation Commission for the City of Pueblo where he was (and continues) to be an advocate for adaptive reuse of historic properties, economic redevelopment and tourism.\n\nCurrently you can find Gregory on the CSU Pueblo campus in the Media & Entertainment Department where he serves as an Adjunct Faculty teaching public relations, managing creative talent, brands and advertising, and Japanese film. Gregory is also a champion for the preservation of local nonprofit newsrooms and the future of  democracy. He cofounded and continues to serve on the Board of Directors of the  Pueblo Star Journal.
