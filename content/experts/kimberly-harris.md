  "bio": "Kimberly Harris is a social entrepreneur who has spent her career working in innovative and entrepreneurial settings, most often at the intersection of aging and technology. She joined Health Tequity, a company of health and technology professionals committed to health equity to help communities to build capacity and dismantle barriers so that everyone can thrive in good health. Prior to this role, she worked as an independent consultant, helping bolster Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Network teamâ€™s capacity to lead training programs for state offices, tribal entities, nonprofit organizations, and community advocates. She also was the lead consultant on a federal grant to create an online training program to teach human services professionals and family caregivers how to implement person-centered trauma-informed care practices in settings that support diverse older adults with a history of trauma. Prior to those projects, she was the VP of Strategic Partnerships and Growth for the Los Angeles-based office of an international startup solution to support homebound and mobility-impaired older adults. \n\nHarris is most recognized as a leader in the field of aging and technology. She worked for nearly a decade at New York City-based nonprofit Older Adults Technology Services on the development of its flagship program, Senior Planet, which she brought to Colorado in 2017. The program included live and virutal training programs statewide and a Senior Planet technology-themed community center in Denver which is located at Lowry.  Under her direction, Senior Planet grew from a vision to an award-winning internationally-recognized and tested model for innovation in aging, and now is incorporated as a charitable affiliate of AARP. Within OATS she also built an internal consulting practice in order to amplify the mission and experience of the nonprofit for government, nonprofit, and corporate partners, and has deep experience in multiple sectors relating to the challenges and opportunities presenting by an aging population. \n\nHarris is a fourth-generation Coloradan, the advisory chair of the Colorado-based intergenerational collaborative LinkAges, a member of the \"Bloomers Project\" (CO-focused think tank for innovation in aging), a member of the Commit to Connect Initiative of the Administration on Community Living and a member of digital equity working groups in multiple states. Harris holds a BA in sociology and anthropology from the University of Redlands, and an MA in Interdisciplinary Humanities and Social Thought from New York University.",
