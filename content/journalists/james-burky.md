  "bio": "I live in Grand Junction but was born and raised in Westminster, graduated from MSU Denver, and interned at The Daily Camera in Boulder and The Denver Post. I'm a sports reporter who has also covered education and business on the news desk. While my beat is sports, I often incorporate news and human interest elements into my coverage. I've dreamed of being a journalist since I was a kid and aspire to be a trustworthy voice for the people.",
